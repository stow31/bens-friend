# Bens's Friend

URL: http://bensfriend.surge.sh/

Built using React

## Purpose

Create and look after your own pet! Maintain your pets health by taking it to the bathroom, feeding it, putting it to bed and playing with it. If your pets health gets too low it may die so make sure you are responsible and give it all the love and care it needs!

## Development Process Script

### Bugs and Updates / Pain points
- Using the useEffect hook with the setIntervals method was difficult. Ended up going with a custom function from Dan Abramov (https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)

### Features I would like to add
- Store progress in the local storage
- Add a money to the game and require money to purchase games and food
- Add more animals
- Ability to customise your pet, change the colours and the breeds

### Plan Break Down
- Wrote down key requirements for the game
- Created wireframes
- Broke down all tasks for a MVP
- Started working through the MVP
- Once MVP was complete added additional features (including feature to add a cat)
